# UN SDG Focus 
    This software focuses on multiple UN SDGs which are: 
    * Goal 2: "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture"
    * Goal 12: "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns"
    * Goal 13: "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"

# Project Idea
    A software that allows users to use their food waste/leftover to make creative and delicious recipes. 

# Project Background
    Globally, around 13 percent of food produced is lost between harvest and retail, while an estimated 17 percent of total global food production is wasted in households, in the food service and in retail all together. Food waste is a significant global issue with environmental, economic, and ethical implications. By providing users with creative ways to use leftovers, this software can help individuals reduce their personal food waste, contributing to a more sustainable food system worldwide.
