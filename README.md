# Project Idea
A software that allows users to use their food waste/leftover to make creative and delicious recipes. 

# Project Background
Food waste is a pressing global issue with far-reaching consequences. Approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted each year, leading to significant environmental, economic, and ethical concerns. Food waste contributes to environmental degradation, including greenhouse gas emissions, excessive water usage, and habitat destruction. As well, reducing food waste not only benefits the environment but also offers economic advantages. By using up leftovers, individuals can save money and make their food budgets go further.
The app will tackle the issue of food waste at its source by helping individuals use what they already have, reducing the volume of food that ends up in landfills.
The app will also provide tailored solutions based on the specific ingredients users have, their dietary preferences, and available kitchen equipment. It will offer a personalized approach to tackling food waste.
